# This is just a silly fake dispatcher script that can be used to test
# the scheduler without requiring real hardware to be present.  To use
# it, run "lava-scheduler manage scheduler --use-fake".  If you want
# to test something in particular, just hack it as required...

# This makes this script not exit when sent SIGINT, to test the
# killing of jobs that do not die easily.

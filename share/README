Template data for lava-server
=============================

To make it easier to setup devices automatically, templates
can be generated from a working instance and then populated
with data from scripts to create JSON files suitable for use
with the south loaddata instructions.

add_device.py reads the definition of a Device and a DeviceType
from lava_scheduler_app.models and genericizes the data to reset
fields to default and provide placeholders for scripts to replace
with user-specified data like the hostname and device type name.

Optionally, add_device.py can also read the definition of a BundleStream
from dashboard_app.models and convert the data to create a default
anonymous lab-health bundle stream if no bundle streams exist on this
instance. Subsequent bundle streams should be created by individual
users with lava-tool as normal.

The objective is to be able to script the initial setup of a LAVA
install to provide enough support to run TestJob 1 without errors.
However, many devices will need small changes to the device configuration
files generated by add_device.py. This is not supported currently.

Developer builds
================

debian-dev-build.sh is a simple wrapper to build ad-hoc packages for
developers to test their local changes. Packages built from the release
branch would use the tag name alone - note that normally release branch
builds will be done by Debian maintainers from official tarballs released
by Linaro. Packages built from personal branches or the master branch
will use the most recent tag name and have a suffix specifying the short
git hash of the most recent commit on that branch. (This may be the same
as the hash of the commit merged into the release branch to create the
tag.)

Developer builds need various Debian/Ubuntu package tools installed:

$ sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev
$ sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install devscripts

The lava-server build-dependencies also need to be installed - these
change from time to time but debian-dev-build.sh will check
dpkg-checkbuilddeps and halt and detail any build-dependencies not
already installed.

A log of the Debian package build will be placed alongside the
packages.

The Debian packaging for lava-server and lava-dispatcher are
available at http://github.com/Linaro/

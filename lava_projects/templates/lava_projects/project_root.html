<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>LAVA uses projects to organize other data structures. Projects are similar
to the project concept in other development tools and web applications.</p>

<p>Anyone is free to <a href="{% url lava.project.register %}">register a
 project</a> and use that to coordinate testing efforts.</p>

LAVA V1 - deprecated
####################

LAVA V1 is the collective name for the LAVA support which involves JSON submissions,
``deploy_linaro_kernel`` and associated actions, Bundles, BundleStreams, Filters
and Image Reports (including Image Reports 2.0).

The 2016.2 release marks the start of the migration away from V1 towards the
pipeline model in V2.

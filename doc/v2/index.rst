LAVA V2 - pipeline model
########################

LAVA V2 is the collective name for the pipeline model for the dispatcher,
YAML job submissions, Results, Queries and Charts. It includes major changes
to the architecture of LAVA which will improve how a distributed LAVA instance
is installed, configured and used for running test jobs.

Migration to V2 started with the 2016.2 release.

LAVA makes the test results available directly from the instance,
without needing to go through ``lava-tool``. The results for any test
job which the user can view can be downloaded in :abbr:`CSV
(comma-separated value)` or YAML format.

For example, the results for test job number 123 are available in CSV
format using: ``https://validation.linaro.org/results/123/csv``. The
same results for job number 123 are available in YAML format using:
``https://validation.linaro.org/results/123/yaml``

If you know the test definition name, you can also download the
results for that specific test definition only in a similar way:
``https://validation.linaro.org/results/123/singlenode-advanced/csv``
for the data in CSV format and
``https://validation.linaro.org/results/123/singlenode-advanced/yaml``
for the YAML format.

Some test jobs can be restricted to particular users or groups of
users. The results of these test jobs will be restricted in the same
way. To download these results, you will need to specify your username
and one of your :ref:`authentication_tokens` when using the REST
API. Remember to quote the URL if using it on the command line, to
avoid the & character being mis-interpreted by your shell, for
example:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ curl 'https://validation.linaro.org/results/123/singlenode-advanced/yaml?user=user.name&token=yourtokentextgoeshereononeverylongline'

Use the **Username** as specified in `your Profile </me>`_ - this may
differ from the username you use if logging in via LDAP.

.. caution:: Take care of your tokens - avoid using personal tokens in
   scripts and test definitions, or any other files that end up in
   public git repositories. Wherever supported, use ``https://`` when
   using a token to avoid it being sent in plain-text.

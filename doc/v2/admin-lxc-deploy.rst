Deploying LXC devices
=====================

LXC is a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features. Through
a powerful API and simple tools, it lets Linux users easily create and manage
system or application containers. LXC devices can run lava tests within a
container without disturbing the dispatcher host. The prime advantage of having
LXC device in LAVA is the ability to provide a transparent, sandboxed
environment with support for different OS types, enabling testing in different
platforms.

Prerequisite
------------

Ensure that LXC is installed in your LAVA dispatcher host, if not use the
following command to install LXC in Debian::

  $ sudo apt install lxc

Refer the following links in order to setup networking for LXC in Debian:

Android testing with LXC support
--------------------------------

:ref:`LXC protocol <lxc_protocol_reference>` is used for Android testing
use-cases which removes the need for writing complex job definitions using
:ref:`Multinode <multinode>`. This is made possible by adding the usb path of
the :term:`DUT` that is attached to the dispatcher. The device configuration
takes a special parameter called `device_info` which will be used to expose the
:term:`DUT` to LXC for Android testing. The `device_info` takes a list of
dictionaries, where each dictionary value can contain keys such as `board_id`,
`usb_vendor_id`, `usb_product_id`.

Examples of `device_info` configuration are as follows.

Example 1 - Single device with just `board_id` ::

 {% set device_info = [{'board_id': '0123456789'}] %}

Example 2 - Single device with `board_id` and `usb_vendor_id` ::

 {% set device_info = [{'board_id': '0123456789', 'usb_vendor_id': '0451'}] %}

Example 3 - Single device with `board_id`, `usb_vendor_id` and `usb_product_id` ::

 {% set device_info = [{'board_id': '0123456789', 'usb_vendor_id': '0451', 'usb_product_id': 'd109'}] %}

.. note:: Do not run `adb daemon` on the dispatcher host, which will grab the
          :term:`DUT` and will hinder exposing it to LXC. Similarly, remove
          `fastboot` packages from the dispatcher host.

.. _add_usb_devices_lxc:

Arbitrary USB devices with LXC support
--------------------------------------

Some workers have other USB devices attached, for example an energy probe,
which also need to be added to the LXC for access by the test shell. These can
be added as supplementary ``device_info`` dictionaries. In the case of an
energy probe, the probe may be measuring a single DUT whilst being connected to
the worker as a USB device. The ``id`` of that USB device needs to be in the
``device_info`` of the DUT so that the test shell running in the LXC can
control the probe.

The keys given in the dictionary are **not** arbitrary and follow the same
rules as for :ref:`Android devices <add_android_devices_lxc>`::

 [{'board_id': '0123456789ABCDEF'}, {'board_id': 'S/NO44440001'}]

.. caution:: Ensure that the ``device_info`` relates to a USB device which is
   attached to the same worker as the DUT but is **not** a DUT itself.

The value to specify is what shows up in ``pyudev`` bindings as the
``ID_SERIAL_SHORT``. This is typically the ``SerialNumber`` reported by
``dmesg`` but it is worth checking:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import pyudev
  >>> context = pyudev.Context()
  >>> [ device.get('ID_SERIAL_SHORT') for device in context.list_devices(subsystem='usb')]
  [u'0000:00:1a.0', None, None, None, None, u'889FFAE94013', None, None, None, None,
  None, u'FTGNRL22', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None,
  None, None, None, None, None, u'0000:00:1d.0', None, None, None]
  >>>

For ``usb_vendor_id``, the corresponding pyudev key is ``ID_VENDOR_ID``.
For ``usb_product_id``, the corresponding pyudev key is ``ID_MODEL_ID``.

If using multiple keys for the same ``device_info``, ensure that the key value
pairs are in a single dictionary within the list of dictionaries::

 {% set device_info = [{'board_id': '0123456789'}, {'board_id': 'adsd0978775', 'usb_vendor_id': 'ACME54321'}] %}

.. note:: Devices which include a forward slash ``/`` in the serial number will have
   that replaced by an underscore when processed through ``pyudev``. e.g.::

    udev: ATTRS{serial}=="S/NO44440001"
    pydev: S_NO44440001
    device_info: {% set device_info = [{'board_id': 'S_NO44440001'}] %}

Configuration: Persistent Containers
------------------------------------
A test job can request a persistent container which will not get destroyed after
the test job is complete. This allows the container to be reused for subsequent test
jobs. This is useful when users want to setup some software on a container and
use it for subsequent test jobs without re-creating the setup every time, which
may prove time consuming.

In such a case the admins can choose to switch the container creation path from
the default i.e., `/var/lib/lxc` to some other path, which could be a larger
partition mounted on the dispatcher to give more space for such persistent
container users. To set a different container creation path on a per dispatcher
basis `lxc_path` key is used in the dispatcher configuration as described in
:ref:`dispatcher_configuration`

Once the `lxc_path` key is set in dispatch configuration, both persistent and
non-persistent containers will get created in this path.

.. note:: LAVA does not have a mechanism to limit the amount of disk space such
          persistent containers could use. Hence, administrators should setup
          some kind of external monitoring in order to watch the size of these
          persistent containers and free space whenever required or destroy
          unused persistent containers.

Configuration: Unprivileged containers as root
----------------------------------------------

This is the recommended configuration for running your LXC devices within a
LAVA dispatcher, provided your container does not access any devices attached
to the host. In this configuration the containers will run as unprivileged
user started by root user.

Allocate additional uids and gids to root::

  $ sudo usermod --add-subuids 100000-165536 root
  $ sudo usermod --add-subgids 100000-165536 root

Then edit ``/etc/lxc/default.conf`` and append lxc.uidmap entry like below::

  lxc.id_map = u 0 100000 65536
  lxc.id_map = g 0 100000 65536

With the above in place any container created as root will be an unprivileged
container.

.. warning:: Do not use unprivileged containers when your container has to
             interact with a :term:`DUT` that is attached to the host machine.

.. note:: To apply configurations system wide for all LXC devices attached to
  the dispatcher use ``/etc/lxc/default.conf`` file.

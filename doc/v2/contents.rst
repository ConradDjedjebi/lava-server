How the documentation is organised
**********************************

The LAVA documentation is continually expanding and improving. This is the
overview to help you know where to look for particular help.

* :ref:`contents_first_steps` - whether you are running your own instance or
  using an existing instance, start here if you are new to LAVA V2.
* :ref:`contents_writing_tests` - this guide takes you through how to design,
  write and debug the tests to be run using LAVA. Worked examples are available
  of an increasing range of deployments and test methods.
* :ref:`contents_results` - LAVA results provide a generic view of how the tests
  performed. This guide also covers how to export result data from LAVA into a
  customised frontend which helps make the raw data more relevant to particular
  teams of developers.
* :ref:`contents_admin_guide` - this guide steps through the complex task of
  administering a LAVA instance, from a single emulated device to a large
  test lab with dozens of devices.
* :ref:`contents_developer_guide` - LAVA is developed in the open and
  contributions are welcome from the community. This guide introduces the code
  structure and design requirements as well as how to contribute patches for
  review.

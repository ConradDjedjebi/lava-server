Logging In
==========

Each LAVA instance offers a :ref:`local_user` and can also be configured
to offer an alternative authentication method:

* :ref:`launchpad_openid`
* :ref:`google_openid`
* :ref:`ldap_authentication`

OpenID is no longer available for all installs of LAVA. The OpenID
support changed in the 2015.12 release due to incompatible
changes in the underlying django support. See :ref:`user_authentication`
for more information.

LDAP authentication relies on local configuration and may involve obtaining
a privileged access token from the LDAP administrators.

Local accounts remain available for all instances.

Whichever authentication method is used, there is no difference in how
users interact with LAVA, once logged in.

.. _local_user:

Local User Account
------------------
A local user account can be created by an administrator within LAVA. The
administrator grants different permissions which allows the user to
perform various operations within LAVA. A typical login screen will
look like the following. In order to login with an username and
password enter your credentials in the provided text boxes and click
"Sign in with username and password" button

Local user accounts can be particularly useful for automated users like
build systems or continuous integration scripts using the XMLRPC API.
The local admin can create the user with a secure password, login as
that user to create a token and then supply the token to the scripts.

Logging into the validation lab in Cambridge
--------------------------------------------

The validation lab in Cambridge is accessible via
http://validation.linaro.org/ which is the official production
instance of LAVA.

The validation lab in Cambridge is now accessed using Linaro LDAP.
In order to login with LDAP, enter your details in the LDAP login fields.

.. note:: If your Linaro email is ``first.second@linaro.org`` then use
   ``first.second`` as your username.

.. image:: ./images/ldap-user-login.png

A successful authentication will redirect you to http://validation.linaro.org/

If you do not have a Linaro LDAP account, you can :ref:`register`.

The LAVA scheduler page looks like the following,

.. index:: token

.. _authentication_tokens:

Authentication Tokens
=====================

In order to securely access LAVA resources via XML-RPC APIs using
lava-tool or XML-RPC clients, an Authentication token should be
created by the user.

.. _note: An authentication token and a username are sufficient to allow
          any remote user to use that account in LAVA. Take care when sharing
          scripts that the token and username are not disclosed. If a
          token becomes compromised, login to that LAVA instance and
          delete the token before creating a new one.

Once the user is logged in to a LAVA instance
(e.g. http://validation.linaro.org/) click on the "API" link which will
bring up a drop down menu on which click on "Authentication Tokens" link.
The following page will appear

.. image:: ./images/authentication-tokens-page.png

Click on "new" button on the above page which raises a dialog box
asking for a "Description" of the token to help you identify and
delete tokens \- if required at a later stage.

.. image:: ./images/create-new-authentication-token.png

Click on the "Create" button to generate the token. The token
will be assigned a token number (which is autogenerated by LAVA).

.. image:: ./images/sample-token-page.png

To display the token that was generated above click on the green "display
this token" button in the Actions column on the above page.

.. image:: ./images/token-display-page.png

If a token is compromised it can be removed by clicking on the red "delete
this token" button in the Actions column. Anyone using that token will no longer be able to
authenticate as You in the system.

.. index:: lava-tool

.. _lava_tool:

lava-tool overview
==================

``lava-tool`` is the command-line tool for interacting with the various
services offered by LAVA via XML-RPC APIs. The full list of API calls
is visible on the **Available methods** link from the API menu::

 http://localhost/api/help

``lava-tool`` is primarily designed to assist users and uses desktop
integration hooks provided by ``python-keyring`` and ``gnome-keyring``.
When scripts need to interact with LAVA, the XMLRPC API calls should be
used directly so that the scripts do not need to prompt for a password
to the local user keyring. Scripts used by build servers and continuous
integration tools should use a dedicated user created by the
administrator of a particular instance),

The API help page includes an example python script to connect to the
local instance. To add token support, use the syntax **username:token**
for the server concerned::

 server = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("https://%s:%s@%s/RPC2" % (username, token, server))

See :ref:`xml_rpc` for more information.

.. _installing_lava_tool:

Installing lava-tool
--------------------

``lava-tool`` is installed alongside LAVA by default, when the top
level ``lava`` package is installed on a :ref:`debian_installation`.
``lava-tool`` can also be installed on any remote machine running a
Debian-based distribution, without needing the rest of LAVA, to allow
a remote user to interact with any LAVA instance on which the user has
an account.::

  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install lava-tool

(If you are installing on Debian Jessie, you may want to first enable
``jessie-backports`` to install an updated ``lava-tool`` to use
some superuser operations or for other updates.)

.. _using_lava_tool:

Using lava-tool
---------------

Once the token is created add it to lava-tool as follows. Click on
"display the token" link on the "Authentication Tokens" page and copy
the token. e.g. if your token was created on validation.linaro.org::

  $ lava-tool auth-add http://<username>@validation.linaro.org/RPC2/
  Paste token for http://<username>@validation.linaro.org/RPC2/:
  Please set a password for your new keyring:
  Please confirm the password:
  Token added successfully for user <username>.

.. note:: Paste the token copied previously when it is asked
          above. Replace *username* with your username. If the keyring is
          created newly, set a password for the same, else enter the
          password for the keyring already created.

.. index:: submit

.. _submit_first_job:

Submitting your first job
=========================

A job defines what image to deploy on the DUT and further actions that
should be performed on the DUT. Jobs are defined in *YAML* files.

Job Definition
--------------

Here's a minimal job that could be executed.

.. code-block:: yaml

 # Sample JOB definition for an x86_64 QEMU
 device_type: qemu
 job_name: kvm-pipeline

 timeouts:
   job:
     minutes: 15
   action:
     minutes: 5
 priority: medium
 visibility: public
 context:
   arch: amd64

 actions:

    - deploy:
        timeout:
          minutes: 5
        to: tmpfs
        images:
            rootfs:
              image_arg: -drive format=raw,file={rootfs}
              url: http://images.validation.linaro.org/kvm-debian-wheezy.img.gz
              compression: gz
        os: debian

        failure_retry: 3
        name: kvm-basic-singlenode
        timeout:
          minutes: 5 # uses install:deps, so takes a few minutes
        definitions:
            - repository: git://git.linaro.org/qa/test-definitions.git
              from: git
              path: ubuntu/smoke-tests-basic.yaml
              name: smoke-tests
            - repository: http://git.linaro.org/lava-team/lava-functional-tests.git
              from: git
              path: lava-test-shell/single-node/singlenode03.yaml
              name: singlenode-advanced

.. _job_submission:

Job Submission
--------------

A job is submitted from the command line (using lava-tool or XMLRPC).
The web UI form is being migrated to pipeline jobs.

Command Line Job Submission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have copied the above job definition to a file, for example
*/tmp/job.yaml* Use the lava-tool as shown below,

::

  $ lava-tool submit-job https://<username>@validation.linaro.org/RPC2/
  /tmp/job.yaml
  Please enter password for encrypted keyring:
  submitted as job id: 82287

.. note:: Replace *username* with your username. Enter the password
          for the encrypted keyring which is the same that was used
          when adding authentication token.

Once the job is submitted successfully, the job-id is returned back,
which could be used in order to check the status of the job on the
UI. In the above submission job-id returned is 82287. Visit
``http://validation.linaro.org/scheduler/job/<job-id>`` in order to see
the details of the job run.

.. commented out until the web ui support is available.

   Web Based Job Submission
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Visit http://validation.linaro.org/scheduler/jobsubmit and paste your
   json file into the window and click "Submit" button. The job
   submission screen is shown below,

   .. image:: ./images/job-submission-screen.png

   .. note:: If a link to job json file is pasted on the above screen,
          the JSON file will be fetched and displayed in the text box
          for submission.

   Once the job is successfully submitted, the following screen appears,
   from which the user can navigate to the job details or the list of
   jobs page.

   .. image:: ./images/web-ui-job-submission-success.png

   Viewing the submitted job will show something like this.

   .. image:: ./images/job-details.png

.. index: results

.. downloading_results:

Downloading test results
------------------------

LAVA V2 makes the test results available directly from the instance,
without needing to go through ``lava-tool``. Currently, the results
for any test job can be downloaded as :abbr:`CSV (comma-separated value)`
and YAML format.

For example, the results for test job number 123 are available as
CSV using::

 http://localhost/results/123/csv

The same results are job number 123 are available as YAML using::

 http://localhost/results/123/yaml

If you know the test definition name, you can download just the
results for that test definition in the same way::

 http://localhost/results/123/singlenode-advanced/csv
 http://localhost/results/123/singlenode-advanced/yaml

Some test jobs can be restricted to particular users or groups of users. The
results of these test jobs are restricted in the same way. To download these
results, you will need to specify your username and one of your
:ref:`authentication_tokens` - remember to quote the URL if using it on
the command line or the & will likely be interpreted by your shell::

 'http://localhost/results/123/csv?user=user.name&token=yourtokentextgoeshereononeverylongline'

 $ curl 'http://localhost/results/123/singlenode-advanced/yaml?user=user.name&token=yourtokentextgoeshereononeverylongline'

Use the **Username** as specified in `your Profile </me>`_ - this may differ to the
username you use when logging in with LDAP.

.. caution:: Take care of your tokens - avoid using personal tokens in scripts
   and test definitions or other files that end up in public git repositories.
   Wherever supported, use ``https://`` when using a token.

.. index: test definitions

.. _test_definitions:

Test Definitions
----------------

In order to run a test, a test definition is required. A test
definition is expressed in YAML format. A minimal test definition
would look like the following ::

  metadata:
      name: passfail
      format: "Lava-Test-Shell Test Definition 1.0"
      description: "Pass/Fail test."
      version: 1.0

  run:
      steps:
          - "lava-test-case passtest --result pass"
          - "lava-test-case failtest --result pass"

In order to run the above test definition with a minimal job file, the
following job json could be used and submitted in the same way as
explained above ::

  run:
      steps:
          - "lava-test-case passtest --result pass"
          - "lava-test-case failtest --result pass"

Features
********

* **Automated validation** - designed for automated processes to create,
  submit and process results of test jobs to validate the development
  process.

* **Parallel scheduling** - multiple test jobs run at the same time
  across multiple devices.

* **Multinode test jobs** - test jobs can be run as a single group of
  tests involving multiple devices.

* **Hardware sharing** - uncommon hardware is shared between disparate
  groups to maximise usage

* **Wide device coverage** - a large number of types of device can be
  supported with instances ranging from one to more than a hundred
  devices available for test jobs.

* **Data export for customisation** - transform the data using custom
  interfaces to make the validation output directly relevant to specific
  teams.

* **Privacy support** - test jobs or types of device can be kept private
  to selected groups, individuals or teams.

* **Live result reporting** - if a test job does fail, all results
  up to the point of failure are retained.

* **UNIX and Android test support** - Test jobs can be run on systems
  running various UNIX flavours or using the Android Debug Bridge to
  interface with mobile devices.

* **Complex network testing** - reconfigurable networking across multiple
  devices using multiple network interfaces.

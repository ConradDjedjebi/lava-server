Version 0.5
===========

This version was released as 2011.06 in the Linaro monthly release process.

Release highlights:

* The dashboard has been split into two components, a generic host for server
  side applications (now called the lava-server) and a test result repository
  and browser (now called the lava-dashboard).
* A big dependency revamp has made it possible to install the dashboard (as
  lava-dashboard) straight from the python package index (pypi.python.org).
  This simplifies deployment in certain environments.
* There is now a :ref:`installation` manual that describes how to deploy the
  dashboard from a PPA.
* It is now possible to browse and discover available data views directly form
  the web interface. This makes it easier to create additional reports.
